I"?<p>This is 3D model of church Saint Moric located in Sumava at south Czechia. Project is beeing made for G4D.<br />
First, I have to say, that I got 3D model from the G4D in Revit and my goal was to make vizualization and project church in correct place using augmented reality.<br />
<a href="https://myhub.autodesk360.com/ue2a46f28/g/shares/SH919a0QTf3c32634dcf9220b99a011d2571?fbclid=IwAR2jE7ycaLDM8OqquhtSV_9YNHdYd2qmUKgAStIRJ8iL8kjGzvYezOy0qQs">Original model</a> was made in Revit wih all BIM information. For me BIM informations was not important and uring my vizualization proces I got rid of them on purpose. Using only polygons of the model. Complete vizualization was taking part in SW 3ds Max. Firstly I had to start mapping textures on the model. In this situation it was time consuming, but possible.<br />
Next thing was abouut enviroment, lighting, ground and other items in closed surronding of church. I created it in CAD, did some tweaks in sky, lights and ground texture.<br />
This model has got also modeled interior with all textures, furnitures and ornaments</p>
