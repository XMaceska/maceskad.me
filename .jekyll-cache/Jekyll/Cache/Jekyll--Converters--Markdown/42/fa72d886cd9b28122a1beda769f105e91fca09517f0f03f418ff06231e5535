I"š	<p>Rad Race Last man stanging is fast paced track race held in Berlin. All riders are racing on kart track. Each lap has 400m and on the begging there are 8 riders on the start and each second lap is one rider eliminated.</p>

<p>I have nice steel track bike Cinelli Gazzetta so when my friend Martin asked me if I go for that race I wasnt hesitating much. There are only space for 128 riders and its very popular race, so beed sold out very soon each year. Both of us bought our starting number almost immidiately after they started sellitng them. They cost 39 euro, but in my opinion its nice price if I compare what I got for that price.</p>

<p>Few months before race I started rading on my fixed biked more often. I did few messenger rides in Prague and also did few trainings on childrenâ€™s traffic playground. Race is mostly about quick turns, fast accelaration, hard brakings and finding limits of tyres and bikes. traffic playground is great for training. I also took my both wheels for tuning to our local bicycle shop, where they found out, that my front wheel is total crap, so I decided to change it for my new road better wheel.</p>

<p>Good part of this trip is that my girfriend Adela went with me as supporter and cheerleader. My friend Martin brought his girlfriend with us also. Day before race we did quite easy walk around Berlin and found best grocery shop where you can buy beer for around 1,5â‚¬ and drink it in. They even have toilet in. Thats typical grocery shop in Berling, I really appreciate this. Unfortunately we had like 8 beers together.</p>

<p>race starts in 5 pm, but registration is from 1 pm. In the morning I had bit big head, but nothing serious. When we arrive, we immideatly started training on track. One time martin touched ground with pedal and fell down. I had also one crash. One girl in front of me sliped and I run into her. Just for reminder its forbidden to have brakes on bikes, so you could handle speed only with your legs through fixed gear. That means if someone slips in front me I will most likely runs into that rider.</p>

<p>I rode like 25 km on track and started bit nervous before start. One more interesting fact is, that 4 time olympic winner <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fabian_Cancellara">Fabian Cancellara</a> also confirmed his presence. I was hoping to race with him. When organizators finnished draw I spotted, that I am in group with him. Wow.</p>

<p>Will be continued</p>
