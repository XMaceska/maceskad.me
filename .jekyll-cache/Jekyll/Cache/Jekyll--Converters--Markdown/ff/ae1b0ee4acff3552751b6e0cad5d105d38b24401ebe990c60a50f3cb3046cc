I"*<p>That was my first real 3D project ever. It was created as attachment for my bachelor thesis. My bachelor thesis was about comparing two CAD softwares specialy made for 3D modeling. The main goal was to create criteriums for rating software used for 3D modeling. I was testing how  software is behaving and what is the result under some circumstances and why. Whole thesis was rated as ‚Äúexcelent‚Äù and you could read it <a href="https://is.cuni.cz/webapps/zzp/detail/198733/43429949/?q=%7B%22______searchform___search%22%3A%22mace%5Cu0161ka%22%2C%22______searchform___butsearch%22%3A%22Vyhledat%22%2C%22______facetform___facets___workType%22%3A%5B%22BP%22%5D%2C%22______facetform___facets___faculty%22%3A%5B%2211310%22%5D%2C%22______facetform___facets___defenseYear%22%3A%5B%222018%22%5D%2C%22PNzzpSearchListbasic%22%3A1%7D&amp;lang=cs">here.</a> (only in czech language)<br /></p>

<p>Many thanks to Miroslav ƒå√°belka who was my leader and thanks to him it was possible to create this.<br /></p>

<p>Dimension of the building I got from IT support at our university. Floorplan included completly everything even electric  appliances, doors, windows, etc. Only problem was with height of ceiling. I had to measure it by my own with laser distance meter Leica. With those dimensions I could start modeling. The whole model was created in 3ds Max and simultaneously in Blender. it tooked some time but I was able to get know both softwares properly. <br /></p>

<p>Final render was set up in SW Lumion, due to it‚Äôs great realistic output, student licence and easy interactivity.</p>
