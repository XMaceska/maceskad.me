I"Â	<p>Praha - Doksy UAC road race is quite short race from Prague to town Doksy. I have already did is year ago and this year I really looked forward for this event especially for co-operating with my friend.<br /><br />
Race was really fast - first 55km was average speed more than 40km/h. Many time I was in the front of peloton and it was very breathtaking feeling to be in front of group of aprox. 50 road riders and pedaling on maximum wattage. Peloton shattered into pieces in first real climb from RÃ¡j to Romanov. I had to fight with convulsions in my calves. Unfortunately, when I shifted my chain came off and got stuck between chainring and frame. Due to this I lost contact and up on the hill I was alone. When I spoted few riders in front of me I sucessfully caught them. We were co-operiting in this small group of riders, where was also my friend that I already mentioned. One rider in front of me did quick direction change and with his backwheel he took off me. That was my first real crash in road cycling. I was worried about my carbon bike immediately. When I finaly got back on my feet I found out, that I have small crank on my frame, totaly destroyed my S-Works helmet, teared up bibs, jersey, front light, saddle, and dented big chainring. It was sad, but I jumped back on my bike and finished last 15km.<br /><br /></p>

<p>When we arrived to Doksy, I realized how sad I am again.It supposed to be great race and I was on good place, but accidents happen.I have no team bike, so I have to repair everything for my own.
<br /><br />
When we drinked few non-alcoholic beers We jumped on our bikes and rides back to Prague. Together it was around 200km. Thats what I call a DAY.
