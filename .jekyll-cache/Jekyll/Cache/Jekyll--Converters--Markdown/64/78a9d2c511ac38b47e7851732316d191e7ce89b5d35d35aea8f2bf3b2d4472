I"Á<h3>Registration </h3>
<p>One day I finished 150km ride with frined around nice hilly places near to Prague. We sat on two quick beers afterride. Frineds of my friend Martin came to visit us and we were talking and suddenly they asked if we are already signed for race Krusnoton. We said: â€œwhat?, Whatsâ€™s Krusnoton?â€. Few minuted later we finished registration on the longest and with highest elevetian race I could imagine.
