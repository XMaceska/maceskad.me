 - firstly it was UAC Prague-Doksy, which is quite short race (73km) from Prague to town Doksy. I have already did is year ago and this year I really looked forward for this event. I was co-operating with my friend. Race was really fast - first 55km was average speed more than 40km/h. Many time I was in the front of peloton and it was very breathtaking feeling to be in front of group of aprox. 50 road riders and pedaling on maximum wattage. Peloton splited in pieces in first reall climb from RÃ¡j to Romanov. I had to fight with convulsions in my calves.
