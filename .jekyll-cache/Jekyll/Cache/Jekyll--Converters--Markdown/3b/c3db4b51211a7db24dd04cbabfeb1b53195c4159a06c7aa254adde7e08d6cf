I"a<p>That was my first real 3D project ever. It was created as attachment for my bachelor thesys. My bachelor thesys was about comparing two CAD software specialy made for 3D modeling. The main goal was to creat criteriums for rating software for 3D modeling. I was testing how each software is behaving and what is the result under some circumstances and why. Whole thesys was rated as “excelent” and you could view it <a href="https://is.cuni.cz/webapps/zzp/detail/198733/43429949/?q=%7B%22______searchform___search%22%3A%22mace%5Cu0161ka%22%2C%22______searchform___butsearch%22%3A%22Vyhledat%22%2C%22______facetform___facets___workType%22%3A%5B%22BP%22%5D%2C%22______facetform___facets___faculty%22%3A%5B%2211310%22%5D%2C%22______facetform___facets___defenseYear%22%3A%5B%222018%22%5D%2C%22PNzzpSearchListbasic%22%3A1%7D&amp;lang=cs">here.</a><br /></p>

<p>Many thanks to Miroslav Čábelka who was my leader and thanks to him it was possible to create this.<br /></p>

<p>Dimension of the building i got from IT support at our university. Florplan included completly everything even electric  appliances, doors, windows, etc. Only problem was with height of ceiling. I had to measure it by my own with laser distance meter Leica. With those dimensions I could start modeling. The whole model was created in 3ds Max and simultaneously in Blender. it tooked some time but I was able to get know both softwares properly. <br /></p>

<p>Final render was set up in SW Lumion, due to its great realistic output, student licence and easy interactivity.</p>
