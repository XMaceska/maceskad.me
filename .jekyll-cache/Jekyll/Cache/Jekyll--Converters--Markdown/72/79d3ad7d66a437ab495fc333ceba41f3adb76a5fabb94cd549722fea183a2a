	<p>This is visualization house at Kasperske Hory town. This house is my dad’s property and he is doing recontruction of that house right now (2020). My dad always wanted to do everything by himself, thats why he wanted to created a 3D model of house and decide what architectonic objects would like include and what not.</p>

<p>The whole outter house was made in 3ds Max by me. The interior of the house was created in SketchUp becaouse of my dad wanted to cooperate with me on the model. We also made pipes distribution the building. Moreover we created furniture and rooms orientation. My dad was asked by few people if they could buy a flat in that building after it will be finished. Now we used big advantage of already created 3D model and designed the whole flat as clients want. I made also video fly-throught the flat and now it feels more realistic and it’s more easy to imagine how it will look like in the future.</p>

<p>This project was my first use of CAD in practice.</p>
