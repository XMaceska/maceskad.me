I"Ð<p>I am curently writing diploma thesys about augmented reality. Main goal of this project will be to create mobile application showing city insfrastructure using augmented reality. Main question is about how to connect GIS data with augmented reality. I am finding augmented reality very useful because of its possiblity see-throught the ground, wall or ather surfaces.
Whole application will be written in ARKit from Apple.
