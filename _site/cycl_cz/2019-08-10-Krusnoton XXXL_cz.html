    <h3>Registration </h3>
<p>One day I finished 150km ride with frined around nice hilly places near to Prague. We sat on two quick beers afterride. Frineds of my friend Martin came to visit us and we were talking and suddenly they asked if we are already signed for race Krusnoton. We said: “what?, Whats’s Krusnoton?”. Few minuted later we finished registration on the longest and with highest elevetian race I could imagine. 
<br /><br /></p>

<h3> Race Day</h3>
<p>Race started at 5:30 AM. I felt great in morning, breakfast was great (honey with pastry - my favourite before ride). When we started there were cobblestones in first curve I was really surprised how many people (not me).  lost their bidons in that curve. First 40km was really fast paced - around 37km/h and I was thinking about how we would survive another 260km. In first hill whole peloton shattered. I was riding with my frined, but he sliped on wet rode and went into ditch and lost some time. Luckily nothing happend to him and he didnt even fall. 
Will be continued.</p>
