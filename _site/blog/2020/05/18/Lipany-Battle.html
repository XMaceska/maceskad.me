    <p>This is project visualizes schema of Lipany battle, which happened at 1436 close to the village Lipany. battle was between radical hussites againts restrained hussites.</p>

<p>That was my first project assigned by G4D. Main purpose of this visualization was to clearly present schema of Lipany battle in 3D. Customer ordered this assigment at G4D to impress jury, while he was vindicating his diploma thesis. His diploma thesis is related to Lipany battle and everything always look better in 3D, thats why he got idea to visualize the battle in 3D. And now thats my job to do it.</p>

<p>It was somehow new for me. Firstly I had to settle out with software licences. I got used to on student licence for everything. In this situation it is completly different. It is real commercial job and every licence have to be validated. Fortunately G4D company have got Autodesk 3ds Max licence purchased. On the other hand they doesn’t have licence for Lumion and Photoshop (I am glad, that I found out, that Gimp Rulezz).</p>

<p>Until this moment all my textures, lights, materials, render job was made in Lumion. To be honest it’s pretty easy software for this kind of job. Now I had to learn to do it everything in 3ds Max. Afterall I could say, that it definitely worth it. 3ds Max has great render settings, amazing UV texture editor and lights. Everything is much more complicated, but result is much more better.</p>

<p>Ground surface I got from DMR 5G, which is laser-scaned ground surface for Czechia. G4D purchased land, which I needed for this project and I had to convert it to mesh (originaly it was only in XYZ points). So to sum up: lots of XYZ points was my starting point.</p>

<p>Later on it was lot of modeling the surface especialy streams and roads, which was there before and aren’t there anymore. I had to deal with vertex paint, reflection at water, multi-sub object textures, environment, fog, sun, displacement, bump and so on. Totally I spent on this project around 80 hours officialy, but to be honest I spent even more, while I was learing new stuff at 3ds Max.</p>

<p>In the end I was bit struggling with export to .obj. G4D wanted to have whole model in .obj for their presentation on website. but unfortunately all textures and materials was complex enough, that it wasn’t easy to export object to .obj just because there were lot’s of 3ds Max specific toolset (when I exported the object it was just plain without texture). But fortunately I found out and learn how to bake textures and export was in the end successfull.</p>

<h3> Renders </h3>

<p>Just to clarify the course of battle:
1 - First there was two side against each other other
2 - Than radicals (blue) slightly attacks restrained hussites (red)
3 - after that radicals did pretended back up and restrained hussites attacked
4 - Next Radicals used their secret weapon - hidden cavalary (blue box) and attaced back.
5 - Restrained hussites had to surrender and their camp was conqured</p>
