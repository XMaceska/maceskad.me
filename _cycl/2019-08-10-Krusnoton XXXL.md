<h3>Registration </h3>
One day I finished 150km ride with friend around nice hilly places near to Prague. We sat on two quick beers afterride. Friends of my friend Martin came to visit us and we were talking and suddenly they asked if we are already signed for race Krusnoton. We said: "what?, Whats's Krusnoton?". Few minuted later we finished registration on the longest and with highest elevetian race I could imagine.

<h3> Race Day</h3>
Race started at 5:30 AM. I felt great in morning, breakfast was great (honey with pastry - my favourite before ride). When we started there were cobblestones in first curve I was really surprised how many people (not me)  lost their bidons in that curve. First 40km was really fast paced - around 37km/h and I was thinking about how we would survive another 260km. In first hill whole peloton shattered. I was riding with my friend, but he sliped on wet rode and went into ditch and lost some time. Luckily nothing happend to him and he didnt even fall. 

I was going in the race in a group of aprox. 10 riders. The great part of this race is, that there was 6 food stalls with free food during the race. There were plenty of pastrys, pancaces, caffeine gels, snacks and drinks. I was trying to not to loose time there, so most of the time I just grabbed few pancaces in my hand and pushed all of them into my mouth and grabbed another full hand, changed bidon and went for ride again. Yes, we had one clever decision with my friend in the morning - to leaf one empty place for bidon. So that means, that I could just throw off empty bidon I recived before and grab another full one. With this technique I lost like 1 or 2 minutes on that food stops - good.

Track of the race was going around water tank Flaje, where we met riders who was going on shorter routes (100km, 150km). I was really suprised how slow they were. That was great for me and I felt like I am going really fast and my mind was restared. It was on my 120km, still 180 km left. I was able to catch another rider who was on also competing in 300km and we decided, that we will try to stick together and help each other. In that time I felt, flat tire on my backwheel. Shit. I had two tubes and two co2 bombs. I stops and full of adrenaline I changed my rear tube in 3 minutes. That was great and probably my personal record.

Race goes on, even throught the city Litvínov, which has really industrial atmosphere. Suddenly I heard some ringing noise in my back. I saw my tire lever and my screw key falls out of my saddle back, becouse I dint zipped it properly. Nevermind I dont have time to stop, so I decided to go on.

Worst part was through the small village Dlouhá Louka, it was really steep and my gears 39-28 wasn't really easy for this 13% hill. That was tought times, but I managed to go through. 
Weather wasnt bad nor great during the race. It was warm, but it was very wet. So road and me was most of the time soaked. In time like 90km to the finnish rain starts properly. I hanged on back wheel of some other rider, becouse we were riding on long straight road. I was trying to save some energy to be in wind cover of another rider. That was successful, but I had completly full face of water. I mean completly. completly completly soaked.

last 50 km of the race was leading through the České středohoří with lots of steep, but short hills. For me it was great I was in group with another rider and we were talking, but still riding fast, good for us. We also overtook one rider, who was also competing in 300km route. 30km before finish I had second flat tire on backwheel. Well shit again. Fortunately rider I was riding with borrowed me tire lever and changing proces started all over again. 3 - 4 minutes in this time and one rider overtook me. I was really motivated to catch him, so my rocket ride starts. I was overtaking may riders who were competing on shorter race and even had to pee, while I was on bike, that was strange, because I peed completly my shoes. I was completly ok with this situation.

In last 2km I was able to see the rider, who overtook me before and I immidiately obvertook him again. He caught my backweehl and we finnish in spurt after 300km race. I won against him and, that was amazing feeling.

I finished 3rd in my category and 16th of 120 riders completly. 

That was a really proper day.
