This is visualization of Campus Albertov. This project was assigned by professors at our university as celebration of 100 years anniversary of Campus Albertov. Future plan is create model 4 periods of Campus Albertov (1850, 1910, 1950, 2019). This model is showing year 2019 and it is not finished yet.

It was my enty-project into 3D modeling. The whole proces of this project was made together with teachers and other students at my university. Main benefit from this project is, that I got used to on working in group. Each building was modeled by different student and my final job was to group, edit and finish all building. Also I made surface, textures and and whole vizualization for this model.
